## Status
Work In Progress

## About
This repo is a ***metroidvania prototype*** developed by Unity2D

I'm a super lover of RPGs, especially Souls, Metroidvanias, Survival games like Terraria and Minecraft and Core Keeper, SLGs like Stardew Valley, Roguelike/Roguelite games like Noita and Dead Cells and so on

You might notice that I fancy ***Pixel Arts*** a lot, and that's why I prefer to develop a pixel 2D RPG. Hope you can enjoy the game and find something common with me through the aesthetic choice I've expressed in this game demo 

## Contents
- You will play as a warrior with 3+ attack skills which can be acquired as the game moves on
- The demo will contains four chapters including platform elements and 2+ boss fights

## Deployment
To deploy this project locally, follow the steps
- Install the corresponding Unity version as `2022.3.17f1c1`
