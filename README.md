## About
This repo is a ***Metroidvania*** game prototype developed by Unity2D

I'm a super lover of RPGs, especially Souls, Metroidvanias, Survival games like Terraria and Minecraft and Core Keeper, SLGs like Stardew Valley, Roguelike/Roguelite games like Noita and Dead Cells and so on

You might notice that I fancy ***Pixel Arts*** a lot, and that's why I prefer to develop a pixel 2D RPG. Hope you can enjoy the game and find something common with me through the aesthetic choice I've expressed in this game demo 

## Contents
- You will play as a warrior with 3+ attack skills and different methods of movement
- The demo will contains several chapters with platform design element and 2+ boss fights

## References
The idea of the gameplay and art design mainly comes from the games such as: `Ender Lilies`, `Hollow Knight`, `Celeste`, `Dark Souls I`, `Katana Zero`, `Phoenotopia Awakening`, etc.

The game assets mainly come from: [Itch](https://itch.io/), [Unity](https://assetstore.unity.com/zh-CN), [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/), [CraftPix](https://craftpix.net/), [Spriters-Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/) and [Twitter](https://x.com). The soundtracks all come from the OST of my loved games and anime.

I learn the game development mainly from the video courses from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/2d-rpg-alexdev/) and [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/) and the official manual from [Unity](https://docs.unity.cn/2021.3/Documentation/Manual/UnityManual.html).
